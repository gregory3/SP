# SEProject-GroceryGuru
My senior project for WIT SE class with group.

***FIRST STEPS***
Clone the repo:
* Hit the clone or download button on the right hand side, and then copy the url.
* Go to your git management app (I use SourceTree, that's the one I'm most comfortable with), and there should be somewhere where you can     either clone, add, or create a local repository. You want to clone this repo, so hit clone. In SourceTree, when originally cloning the project, there is an advanced options tab. Click this and then select the repo you want to push to.
* Next it will have you enter the url you copied, along with where you want the repository to be in your file system. Put it wherever you     want and any other information you need to input and clone.
* Once it is cloned, you will be on the master branch, you do ***NOT*** want to be on the master branch, the master branch is where we will   put things when the sprint is completed.
* Somewhere in your app you will see a place to view remote branches. Find this place, and look for a branch with your name on it.
* Once you locate your designated branch you want to checkout the remote branch locally, i.e, copy that branch into your local repository.   This branch is where you want to work in.
* Now you should be all set to begin working on your code.
* Having our own branches to work in is a safe way to work on our own portions of code without worrying about merge conflicts if someone     pushes new code.
* If you want to work on code with another group member, feel free to create a new branch so that you both can work on the same portions of   code, and have each others changes in real time.
* With your own branch, you can push as many times as you want, and it won't affect the develop branch.

***Pull Requests***
* Pull Requests (PRs) are a pretty neat thing, and I think they are very helpful when trying to avoid pushing code that's broken.
* When you finish a ToDo that's assigned to you, and you think it's ready to go into the develop branch, then navigate [HERE](https://github.com/partlows/SEProject-GroceryGuru/compare) to create a new pull request. 
* This will compare your branch with the develop branch. Enter the information that you want to give, and add the recipents to the pull   request and it will send out a message asking the recipients to view your code. 
* Once it gets approval from one of the recipients it will be merged into the develop branch. This is just a little safeguard, and         it helps get another pair or pairs of eyes looking at what you've done
